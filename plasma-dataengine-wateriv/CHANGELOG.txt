WaterIV Data Engine CHANGELOG

 ----------------------------------
 0.3.1 : plasma-dataengine-wateriv

 * Changed behavior: sources that are a simple list of sites now request PT2H
   values (last hour) instead of just the most recent value.
 * Changed behavior: datestrings in _all are now converted to TextDate to avoid
   javascript problems with ISO8601.
 * Added behavior: when updating previous values are preserved and new values 
   accumulated up to MAX_VALUES; requests larger than MAX_VALUES are honored.
 * Added constant: MAX_VALUES = 672 (1 week of values at 15min).
 * fixed (issue#15): recent_date and recent_value are actually most recent!
 * incremented VERSION_ID = 4; previous versions afflicted with issue#15.

 ----------------------------------
 0.3.0 : plasma-dataengine-wateriv
 
 * fixed (issue#14): recent_qualifiers now QList<QVariant>
 * Added key: series_<siteCode>_<paramCode>_<stateCode>_recent_change; percent 
   increase over previous value.
 * Created WaterIVData interface; added implementation WaterIVDataWaterML
 * Added keys: toc_count and toc_# | 0 <= # < toc_count (table of contents)
 * Added Keys: series_<siteCode>_<paramCode>_<statCode>_name and code
 * Moved keys: timeseries_#_values_#_ to series_<siteCode>_<paramCode>_
   <statCode>_<methodId>_
 * Moved keys: timeseries_#_variable_ to series_<siteCode>_<paramCode>_
 * Moved keys: timeseries_#_sourceInfo_ to series_<siteCode>_
 * Removed Key: timeseries_#_variable_options
 * incremented VERSION_ID = 3; compatibility broken due to major changes in keys.
 * fixed (issue#8): an empty data container MUST be set in sourceAddedEvent

 ----------------------------------
 0.2.1 : plasma-dataengine-wateriv

 * incremented VERSION_ID = 2; compatibility broken (issue#8 modifies behavior)
 * fixed (issue#8): any data returned is delivered at once and not spread out
   over asyncronous functions (caused plasmoids to fail to recognize updates).
 * fixed (issue#7): previous timeseries_count preserved on network errors 
   during update instead of blindly set to 0.
 * added debian/ files for packing ubuntu debs; 

 ----------------------------------
 0.2.0 : plasma-dataengine-wateriv

 * Added support for Daily Values (DV) service; engine now accepts psuedo urls 
   that specify which service (DV/IV) to use (defaults to IV).
 * Added keys: timeseries_#_values_count, values_#_method_id, values_#_method_description
 * Moved keys: timeseries_#_values to timeseries_#_values_#; bugfix 5; engine now
   supports multiple sets of values (of differing methods) within a timeseries;
   change breaks compatibility with plasmoids using older versions.
 * Added constant: VERSION_ID = 1; a unique version id that is incremented when
   compatibility with older plasmoids is broken due to major changes.
 * Added keys: engine_version, net_request_isvalid, net_request_error
   
 ----------------------------------
 0.1.0 : plasma-dataengine-wateriv

 * Initial release.

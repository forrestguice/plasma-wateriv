WaterIV Data Engine ChangeLog

 ----------------------------------
 0.2.1 : plasma-dataengine-wateriv

 * incremented VERSION_ID = 2; compatibility broken (issue#8 modifies behavior)
 * (fixed)(issue#8) any data returned is delivered at once and not spread out
   over asyncronous functions (caused plasmoids to fail to recognize updates).
 * (fixed)(issue#7) previous timeseries_count preserved on network errors 
   during update instead of blindly set to 0.
 * added debian/ files for packing ubuntu debs; 

 ----------------------------------
 0.2.0 : plasma-dataengine-wateriv

 * Added support for Daily Values (DV) service; engine now accepts psuedo urls 
   that specify which service (DV/IV) to use (defaults to IV).
 * Added keys: timeseries_#_values_count, values_#_method_id, values_#_method_description
 * Moved keys: timeseries_#_values to timeseries_#_values_#; bugfix 5; engine now
   supports multiple sets of values (of differing methods) within a timeseries;
   change breaks compatibility with plasmoids using older versions.
 * Added constant: VERSION_ID = 1; a unique version id that is incremented when
   compatibility with older plasmoids is broken due to major changes.
 * Added keys: engine_version, net_request_isvalid, net_request_error
   
 ----------------------------------
 0.1.0 : plasma-dataengine-wateriv

 * Initial release.
